This repository contains a computer vision model trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The model implemented here utilizes deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in digit classification.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for training and evaluation of the model.

## Model Architecture

The computer vision model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. This architecture allows the model to learn hierarchical features from the input images and make accurate predictions.

## Training

The model is trained using the training set of the MNIST dataset. During training, the model learns to optimize its parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent. The training process involves iterating over the training set multiple times, adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the loss function.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated using the testing set of the MNIST dataset. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance and its ability to correctly classify the digits.

## Usage

To use the computer vision model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies and libraries.
2. Download the MNIST dataset and preprocess it.
3. Train the model using the preprocessed dataset.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using the testing set.
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new unseen images.

## Conclusion

This computer vision model trained on the MNIST dataset demonstrates the power of deep learning in digit recognition. By leveraging convolutional neural networks, the model achieves high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different architectures and techniques to further improve the model's performance.
